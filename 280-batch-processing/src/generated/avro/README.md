**Why is it not yet migrated to bazel**
>This was the PR for avro plugin in bazel -> https://github.com/harness/harness-core/pull/21636/files
the plugin required this argument with bazel build --incompatible_restrict_string_escapes=false which was creating some issue with bazel_script, that's why it wasn't merged
